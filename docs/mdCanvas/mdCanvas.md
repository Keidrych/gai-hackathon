# Canvas
Ad Infinitum

# Problem
1. Lead Time to Change 
1. Environment Management
1. Kubernetes Complexity and TCO 

# Customer-segment
1. Self Hosting Rancher Platforms 
1. Containerisable Platforms
1. PC/BC Engineering

# Unique-Value-Proposition
- CI is a development process. CD is an operational process. Deliver value faster, with only the change required.

# Solution
- CNCF Compliant Kubernetes (impl: EKS) 
- GitOps Controlled Deployment (impl: Github)
- Dynamic Preview Environments

# Channels
- DevOps Guild Forum
- IAG Kubernetes User Groups 

# Cost-Structure
- EKS - $16.80 per cluster per week
- ArgoCD - OpenSource - Training and Maintenance
- Hosting - EC2 or Fargate

# Revenue-Stream
- People; De-risk Kubernetes under resourcing
- Tested Features in Main
- Hosting Cost Optimisation 
- License Cost Optimisation

# Key-Metrics
- Lead Time to Change
- Deployment Frequency
- Cost

# Unfair-advantage
- Deploy to Kubernetes _independent of your CI_ (as long as we can get a container)
- Prototype and Canary environments before changing direction
- Faster, Safer, Simpler
